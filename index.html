            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <p>Pysazz is a CSS Framework Build tool that utilizes SASS as a way to combine CSS from your favorite frameworks.  Pysazz gives you the ability to take the buttons from Bootstrap, combine it with your favorite CSS reset, and write your own SASS files and then compile those files into your own CSS framework.</p>
                <p>Pysazz is a command-line interface written in Python.  Pysazz is easy-to-use, cross-platform, and compatible with any existing CSS or SASS files.  This means that you pick your favorite features from any existing CSS frameworks and have these features compiled into your own unique framework.</p>

                <h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
                <p>Pysazz will eventially have compiled executables to run, but for now, just drop the "pysazz.py" file into your project.  Pysazz's dependencies include Python 3.4.1 and libsass for Python which you can download here: <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libsass">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/libsass</a></p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
                <p>At the moment, Pysazz has three basic commands:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>pysazz init</li>
                    <li>pysazz compile [args]</li>
                    <li>pysazz update</li>
                </ul>
                <p><code>pysazz init</code> generates a basic xml configuration file for your framework, see configuration to learn how to edit this file.</p>
                <p><code>pysazz compile [args]</code> downloads any files that do not already exist and compiles them into a CSS file.  If a file has already been downloaded, pysazz will not overwrite it.  Possible arguments include -compressed, -compact, -nested, and -expanded.</p>
                <p><code>pysazz update</code> updates your entire codebase.  The update command will redownload and overwrite all files included in your config file and recompile the CSS.  Be careful when using this as any changes you have made to downloaded files will be overwritten.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-xs-12">
                <h2>Configuration</h2>
                <p>Running <code>pysazz init</code> will generate a file called "pysazz.config.xml".  This file is where you will specify the file structure and css files for your project.</p>
                <p>Here is an example of a pysazz config file:</p>
                <pre>
                    <code>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;config&gt;
    &lt;links&gt;
        &lt;link folder="partials" saveas="_reset.scss"&gt;http:http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css&lt;/link&gt;

&lt;/config&gt;

                <p>Every file to be included in the final compiled CSS must be put in a link tag.  Link tags can have a folder attribute and a saveas attribute.  Saveas is used to rename .css and sass files to avoid naming conflicts.  If you wish to include a .css file in your project, you will need to use the saveas attribute to rename the file to "_NameOfFile.scss".  The folder attribute tells Pysazz the file structure of your css framework, and it also saves the download file in the folder that you specify.  You do not need to specify a trailing slash.  The folders do not need to be created prior to running Pysazz.  It will generate them for you automatically if they are not already created.</p>
                <p>Inside the link tag, you can specify files to be download by providing a url that starts with "http" or by specifying a relative URL path.  It is also important to note that you can also include javascript, font, and image files in your configuration file, but you will need to add these files manually to your CSS or HTML document.</p>
                <p>Please read Best Practices</p>

                <h2 id="bestpractices">Best Practices</h2>
                <p>It is advised that you structure your config file in the following manner:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>CSS Reset</li>
                    <li>A custom sass file</li>
                    <li>Variable Files</li>
                    <li>Mixins</li>
                    <li>Partial sass files</li>
                    <li>A custom sass file</li>
                </ol>
                <p>When Sass compiles your CSS, it reads from top-to-bottom.  Your CSS is also output in a top-to-bottom manner.  This is why the files must be specified in this way.  It is recommended that you put a CSS Reset and a custom file in the first two spots so that you will not run into problems having default CSS behaviors set by other files.  Sass files containing variables need to be specified at the top so that the mixins can have the proper information to compile.  Any Sass files that contain mixins should be specified after the variables and before the partial sass files that use the mixins as dependencies.  Finally, declare your own custom partial sass file at the end of the configuration file so that you can override and write your own css to add to your framework.</p>
